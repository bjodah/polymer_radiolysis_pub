`polymer_radiolysis_pub <https://github.com/bjodah/polymer_radiolysis_pub>` contains the source code for our model
of radioylsis of aqueous polymer solutions. An archived copy of the Dockerimage is published on Zenodo for reproducibility.

Usage
-----
To compile the source code and run a simulation you may run:

.. code:: bash

   $ curl -LOs https://zenodo.org/record/2579871/files/dockerimage__polymer_radiolysis_pub.tar.xz
   $ openssl sha256 dockerimage__polymer_radiolysis_pub.tar.xz
   SHA256(dockerimage__polymer_radiolysis_pub.tar.xz)= f3560be844775ce2d0e2ffe1a9ca52109a4bf1e3f88b9058f5ab72f3e75d0266
   $ xz --decompress - < dockerimage__polymer_radiolysis_pub.tar.xz | docker image load
   $ ./scripts/run_dockerized_build_and_test.sh

this will compile the source code under ``src/`` and run a small test-simulation.
